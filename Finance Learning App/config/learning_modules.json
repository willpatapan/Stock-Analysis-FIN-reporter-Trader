    "content": "# What are Stocks?\n\nA **stock** (also called equity or share) represents ownership in a company. When you buy a stock, you become a partial owner of that company.\n\n## Key Concepts:\n\n### 1. Ownership\n- Each share represents a fractional ownership stake\n- Shareholders have voting rights in company decisions\n- You benefit from the company's success through price appreciation and dividends\n\n### 2. Stock Exchanges\n- **NYSE** (New York Stock Exchange): Oldest and largest exchange\n- **NASDAQ**: Electronic exchange, tech-heavy\n- Stocks are bought and sold through these exchanges\n\n### 3. How Stock Prices Work\n- Prices are determined by **supply and demand**\n- More buyers than sellers → price goes up\n- More sellers than buyers → price goes down\n\n### 4. Market Capitalization\n- **Market Cap** = Stock Price × Total Shares Outstanding\n- **Large Cap**: > $10 billion (e.g., Apple, Microsoft)\n- **Mid Cap**: $2-10 billion\n- **Small Cap**: < $2 billion\n\n### 5. Why Companies Issue Stock\n- Raise capital for growth and expansion\n- Reward employees with stock options\n- Increase liquidity and public visibility\n\n## Example:\nIf Apple has 15 billion shares outstanding and the stock price is $180:\n- Market Cap = $180 × 15 billion = **$2.7 trillion**\n- You own 100 shares = You own 0.00000067% of Apple!\n\n## Remember:\n- Stocks represent real ownership in real companies\n- Stock prices reflect the market's perception of a company's future value\n- Over the long term, stock markets have historically trended upward",

    "content": "# Risk and Return: The Golden Rule of Investing\n\n## The Risk-Return Tradeoff\n\nThe **fundamental principle** of investing:\n> Higher potential returns come with higher risk\n\n### What is Return?\n**Return** is the profit or loss on an investment over a period:\n\n```\nReturn = (Ending Value - Beginning Value + Dividends) / Beginning Value\n```\n\n**Example:**\n- Bought stock at $100\n- Sold at $120\n- Received $5 in dividends\n- Return = ($120 - $100 + $5) / $100 = **25%**\n\n### What is Risk?\n**Risk** is the uncertainty about future returns. Key types:\n\n1. **Market Risk**: Overall market movements\n2. **Company Risk**: Specific to one company\n3. **Industry Risk**: Sector-specific issues\n4. **Liquidity Risk**: Difficulty selling quickly\n\n### Measuring Risk: Standard Deviation\n\n**Volatility** (measured by standard deviation) shows how much returns vary:\n- **Low volatility**: Returns are stable and predictable\n- **High volatility**: Returns swing wildly up and down\n\n**Example:**\n- **Bond Fund**: Average 5% return, volatility 2% → Low risk\n- **Tech Stock**: Average 15% return, volatility 30% → High risk\n\n### Risk-Adjusted Returns\n\nSmart investors care about **return per unit of risk**:\n\n**Sharpe Ratio** = (Return - Risk-Free Rate) / Volatility\n\n**Higher Sharpe Ratio = Better risk-adjusted returns**\n\n## Diversification: The Free Lunch\n\n> \"Don't put all your eggs in one basket\"\n\n**Diversification** reduces risk by spreading investments:\n- Own stocks in different industries\n- Mix stocks with bonds\n- Include international exposure\n\n### Example:\n- **Portfolio A**: 100% tech stocks → High risk\n- **Portfolio B**: 50% tech, 30% healthcare, 20% bonds → Lower risk\n\nBoth might have similar returns, but Portfolio B is less risky!\n\n## Time Horizon Matters\n\n- **Short-term** (< 3 years): Lower risk tolerance\n- **Long-term** (> 10 years): Can handle more volatility\n\nHistorically, stocks have always been positive over 20+ year periods!\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\n1. Higher returns require accepting higher risk\n2. Volatility measures how much returns fluctuate\n3. Diversification reduces risk without sacrificing returns\n4. Your time horizon should guide your risk tolerance\n5. Focus on risk-adjusted returns, not just returns",

    "content": "# Technical Analysis: Reading the Market's Language\n\n## What is Technical Analysis?\n\n**Technical Analysis** studies past price and volume data to predict future price movements.\n\n**Core Belief**: \"History repeats itself\" - patterns in the past will occur again\n\n### Technical vs Fundamental Analysis\n\n| Technical | Fundamental |\n|-----------|-------------|\n| Studies **price charts** | Studies **company financials** |\n| Short to medium term | Long term |\n| **When** to buy/sell | **What** to buy |\n| Used by traders | Used by investors |\n\n## Key Technical Indicators\n\n### 1. Moving Averages (MA)\n\nSmooths price data to identify trends:\n\n**Simple Moving Average (SMA)**:\n```\nSMA = (Sum of closing prices over N days) / N\n```\n\n**Common periods:**\n- **SMA 50**: Medium-term trend\n- **SMA 200**: Long-term trend\n\n**Golden Cross**: SMA 50 crosses above SMA 200 → **Bullish signal**\n**Death Cross**: SMA 50 crosses below SMA 200 → **Bearish signal**\n\n### 2. Relative Strength Index (RSI)\n\nMomentum oscillator (0-100) showing if stock is overbought or oversold:\n\n- **RSI > 70**: **Overbought** → Might decline soon\n- **RSI < 30**: **Oversold** → Might rally soon\n- **RSI = 50**: Neutral\n\n### 3. MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)\n\nShows relationship between two moving averages:\n\n**Components:**\n- **MACD Line**: 12-day EMA - 26-day EMA\n- **Signal Line**: 9-day EMA of MACD\n- **Histogram**: MACD - Signal\n\n**Signals:**\n- MACD crosses **above** signal line → **Buy**\n- MACD crosses **below** signal line → **Sell**\n\n### 4. Bollinger Bands\n\nVolatility bands around a moving average:\n\n- **Upper Band**: SMA + (2 × Standard Deviation)\n- **Middle Band**: 20-day SMA\n- **Lower Band**: SMA - (2 × Standard Deviation)\n\n**Trading Strategy:**\n- Price touches **lower band** → **Oversold**, potential buy\n- Price touches **upper band** → **Overbought**, potential sell\n- Bands **squeeze** → Low volatility, breakout coming!\n\n### 5. Volume\n\n**Volume confirms price movements:**\n\n- **Rising price + High volume** = Strong uptrend ✅\n- **Rising price + Low volume** = Weak uptrend ⚠️\n- **Falling price + High volume** = Strong downtrend ❌\n\nAlways check: \"Is volume confirming this move?\"\n\n## Chart Patterns\n\n### Bullish Patterns:\n1. **Cup and Handle**: Rounded bottom + small consolidation\n2. **Double Bottom**: Two equal lows = strong support\n3. **Ascending Triangle**: Higher lows + flat resistance\n\n### Bearish Patterns:\n1. **Head and Shoulders**: Peak (head) between two lower peaks\n2. **Double Top**: Two equal highs = strong resistance\n3. **Descending Triangle**: Lower highs + flat support\n\n## Support and Resistance\n\n**Support**: Price level where buying interest is strong enough to prevent further decline\n\n**Resistance**: Price level where selling interest prevents further rise\n\n**Key Rule**: \n- Broken **support** becomes new **resistance**\n- Broken **resistance** becomes new **support**\n\n## Using Multiple Indicators\n\n**Best Practice**: Combine multiple indicators for confirmation\n\n**Example Trading Strategy:**\n1. RSI shows oversold (< 30)\n2. Price touches lower Bollinger Band\n3. MACD crosses above signal line\n4. High volume on bounce\n\n**All 4 confirm** → High-probability buy signal!\n\n## Limitations of Technical Analysis\n\n⚠️ **Important caveats:**\n- Not foolproof - false signals occur\n- Works best in trending markets\n- Ignores fundamental value\n- Past patterns don't guarantee future results\n- Can become self-fulfilling prophecy\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\n1. Technical analysis uses price/volume data to predict future moves\n2. Moving averages identify trends\n3. RSI and MACD show momentum\n4. Bollinger Bands indicate volatility and extremes\n5. Always use multiple indicators for confirmation\n6. Volume should confirm price movements",
